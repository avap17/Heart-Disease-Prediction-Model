# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model Project Introduction and Goal
In this project, I create a prediction model for heart disease to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical factors such as chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
# Dataset
Based on a dataset found from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
# Training
To predict heart disease in patients accurately, I test different algorithms / classifications and then compare which has the highest accuracy. The algorithms I train my model on to test and analyze are:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
